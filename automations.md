# ⚡ Home Assistant Automations

Welcome to the LewnaTech Automation Library – a growing collection of smart, useful automations designed to enhance your Home Assistant setup.

Each automation below includes a description, YAML file, and guidance on how to implement and customise it for your own system.

---

## 🧩 How to Use

- Each automation is provided as a standalone `.yaml` file inside the `automations/` folder.
- You can copy the contents into your `automations.yaml` file or import them via the Home Assistant UI.
- YAML files contain **placeholder entity IDs** like `light.example_light` or `sensor.example_sensor`.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> You must **replace these placeholders** with your actual entity names from your own Home Assistant setup before saving.
