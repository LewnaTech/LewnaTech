# ⚡ Home Assistant Automations

Welcome to the LewnaTech Automation Library – a growing collection of smart, useful automations for your Home Assistant setup.

---

## 🧩 How to Use

- Each automation is a standalone `.yaml` file in the `automations/` folder.
- You can copy the YAML into your `automations.yaml` file or import it via the Home Assistant UI.
- Placeholders like `light.example_light` must be replaced with your actual entity names.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always review YAML and update entity names to match your Home Assistant setup.
